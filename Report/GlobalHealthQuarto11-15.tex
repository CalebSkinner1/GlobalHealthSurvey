Below is a Chi Squared Test. This tests to see if the two distributions
of perceived barriers to low-resource healthcare are distinct from one
another. The test cannot confirm that there is a distinction. In other
words, the overall difference in perceived barriers to healthcare in low
resource settings of those who are interested in a Global Health Career
and those who are uninterested is not significant.
