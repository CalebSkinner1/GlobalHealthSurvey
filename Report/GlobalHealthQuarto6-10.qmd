A. Overall Results for Global Health Opportunities Availability.

YNResponses <- c("Yes", "I don't know", "No")

  mutate(Q18 = case_when(
    Q18 == "I don't know" ~ .5,
    Q18 == "Yes" ~ 1,
    Q18 == "No" ~ 0)
  )

df18 %>%
  group_by(Q18) %>%
  summarise(
    Counts = n()
  ) %>% ggplot(aes(fct_relevel(Q18, YNResponses), Counts)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = 'cornsilk3') +
  labs(title = "Are there enough global health opportunities?", x = "", y = "") +

B. Global Health Opportunities by Global Health Career Interest

```{r}
df18Int <- df18 %>%
  filter(Q14 != "") %>% 
  group_by(Q14, Q18) %>%
  summarise(
    Count = n()
  )
ggplot(df18Int, aes(Q14, Count, fill = fct_relevel(Q18, YNResponses))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Opportunities in Global Health by Global Health Interest",
       x = "Global Health Career Interest",
       fill = "Enough Global Health Opportunities:", y = "") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  geom_text(aes(label = signif(Count)), vjust = -.1, position = position_dodge(width = .9)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limit = c(0, 43))
```

```{r}
df18Int %>% group_by(Q14) %>%
  mutate(
    Decimal = Count / sum(Count),
    Percent = percent(Decimal, accuracy = .1)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(Q14, Count), Decimal,

The following is a t-test measuring the difference in belief that there are sufficient Global Health opportunities for pre-med students in those who have expressed interest in a Global Health Career and those who have not. For this t-test, I counted "I don't know" responses to the sufficient Global Health Opportunities Question as 1/2 a "yes" and 1/2 a "no".
The results are significant. Those who have express an interest in a Global Health Career indicate that there are not sufficient Global Health Opportunities at a higher rate than those who have not expressed an interest in a Global Health Career.

```{r}
t.test(df18ttest %>% filter(Q14 == "No") %>% select(Q18),
       df18ttest %>% filter(Q14 == "Yes") %>% select(Q18))
```

The following is a second t-test measuring the difference in belief that there are sufficient Global Health opportunities for pre-med students in those who have expressed interest in a Global Health Career and those who have not. For this t-test, I removed all "I don't know" responses.
The results are not significant. This is likely because a large amount of respondents selected "I don't know." This drops the sample size to only 80.

```{r}
t.test(df18ttest %>% filter(Q14 == "No", Q18 != .5) %>% select(Q18),
       df18ttest %>% filter(Q14 == "Yes", Q18 != .5) %>% select(Q18))
```
