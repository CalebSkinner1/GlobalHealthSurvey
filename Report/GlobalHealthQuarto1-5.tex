The following is a t-test measuring the difference in interest in a
Global Health Career in those who have lived outside the US and those
who have not. For this t-test I counted ``unsure'' responses as 1/2 a
``yes'' and 1/2 a ``no''. The results are significant. Those who have
lived outside the US demonstrate a higher interest in a Global Health
Career than those who have not lived outside the US.

\begin{verbatim}
# 
#   Welch Two Sample t-test
# 
# data:  df14ttest %>% filter(Q12 == "No") %>% select(Q14) and df14ttest %>% filter(Q12 == "Yes") %>% select(Q14)
# t = -3.8394, df = 49.077, p-value = 0.0003537
# alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
# 95 percent confidence interval:
#  -0.3401720 -0.1064276
# sample estimates:
# mean of x mean of y 
# 0.6215278 0.8448276
\end{verbatim}

The following is also a t-test measuring the difference in interest in a
Global Health Career in those who have lived outside the US and those
who have not. For this t-test I removed ``unsure'' responses from the
data. Once again, the results are significant. Those who have lived
outside the US demonstrate a higher interest in a Global Health Career
than those who have not lived outside the US.

\begin{verbatim}

# t = -3.4202, df = 74.733, p-value = 0.001017

Below is a Chi Squared Test. This tests to see if the two distributions
of interest in the global health fields are distinct from one another.
The test cannot confirm that there is a distinction. In other words, the
difference in interest of the various global health fields of those who
lived abroad and those who did not live abroad is not significant.
