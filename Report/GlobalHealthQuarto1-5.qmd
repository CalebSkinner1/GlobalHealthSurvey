## 2. How do pre-medical students perceive a career in global health?

A. Overall Responses to pursuing a career in Global Health.
<!-- Q14 -->

```{r}

    Q14 == "Unsure" ~ .5,
    Q14 == "Yes" ~ 1,
    Q14 == "No" ~ 0)

# Bar Graph

  labs(title = "Interested in a Global Health Career?", x = "", y = "") +
  geom_text(aes(label = signif(Count)), nudge_y = 3)
```

\newpage

B. Pursuing a career in Global Health grouped by those who have lived abroad.

```{r}

The following is a t-test measuring the difference in interest in a Global Health Career in those who have lived outside the US and those who have not. For this t-test I counted "unsure" responses as 1/2 a "yes" and 1/2 a "no".
The results are significant. Those who have lived outside the US demonstrate a higher interest in a Global Health Career than those who have not lived outside the US.

```{r}
# t test of Career in Global Health by lived outside the US
# Keep unsure as .5
# results are significant. True difference of means is not equal to 0.
# p-value = .00035
# mean of not lived outside US: .622
# mean of lived outside US: .845
t.test(df14ttest %>% filter(Q12 == "No") %>% select(Q14),
       df14ttest %>% filter(Q12 == "Yes") %>% select(Q14))
```

The following is also a t-test measuring the difference in interest in a Global Health Career in those who have lived outside the US and those who have not. For this t-test I removed "unsure" responses from the data.
Once again, the results are significant. Those who have lived outside the US demonstrate a higher interest in a Global Health Career than those who have not lived outside the US.

```{r}
# Remove unsure observations
# results are significant. True difference of means is not equal to 0.
# p-value = .00102
# mean of not lived outside US: .722
# mean of lived outside US: .955
t.test(df14ttest %>% filter(Q12 == "No", Q14 != .5) %>% select(Q14),
       df14ttest %>% filter(Q12 == "Yes", Q14 != .5) %>% select(Q14))

Below is a Chi Squared Test. This tests to see if the two distributions of interest in the global health fields are distinct from one another. The test cannot confirm that there is a distinction. In other words, the difference in interest of the various global health fields of those who lived abroad and those who did not live abroad is not significant.

In other words, the difference between the number of fields selected between those who lived abroad and did not live abroad is insignificant.

This tests to see if the distribution of the preference of academic disciplines preferred for global health is distinct when separated by respondent's stated interest in Global Health. The test cannot confirm that there is a distinction.
