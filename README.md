## GlobalHealthSurvey

This project analyzes an undergraduate survey on Global Health in early 2021-2022. The survey was answered by about 250 undergraduate students from various universities. The analysis
covers 15 questions from the survey and centers around the students' interest in a career in Global Health. The analysis is mainly descriptive in nature with histograms giving
the survey writers a better idea of the results.
